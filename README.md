### What I learned

This project expanded my knowledge in various areas. I gained valuable insights into effectively integrating Firestore, Storage, and Firebase Authentication in a single project, as well as successfully deploying it to Vercel. Moreover, I appreciated delving into Next.js, which offers a unique approach bit distinct from React.js. Noteworthy aspects of Next.js include the flexibility to choose server-side or client-side rendering for components, the built-in inclusion of Tailwind CSS without the need for manual configuration, and the convenient routing capability without the requirement of installing an additional package. This project not only broadened my skill set but also reinforced the power and advantages Next.js brings to future endeavors.
